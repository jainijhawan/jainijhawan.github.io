# RB2B Visitor Data Access - How It Really Works

## ❌ What We Incorrectly Assumed

Our initial implementation assumed we could access RB2B visitor data directly through JavaScript variables like `window.reb2b.visitor`. **This is incorrect.**

## ✅ How RB2B Actually Works

RB2B is a **dashboard-based system**:
1. The script collects visitor data
2. Sends it to **RB2B's servers** (not your browser)
3. Stores it in **their dashboard**
4. Makes it available through **their integrations**

## Current Situation

### What You Have (RB2B Free Plan):
- ✅ **RB2B script** collecting visitor data
- ✅ **Basic visitor tracking** with EmailJS notifications
- ✅ **Dashboard access** at RB2B to see identified visitors
- ❌ **No direct data access** for email notifications
- ❌ **No email addresses** in free plan
- ❌ **No webhook/API access**

### What's Working Now:
Your website sends email notifications with:
- **Basic visitor info**: IP, location, device, browser
- **Note**: RB2B identification data only in RB2B dashboard
- **Limitation**: No names, emails, or LinkedIn profiles in email

## Your Options

### Option 1: Keep Current Setup (FREE)
**What you get:**
- Basic visitor notifications via email
- RB2B identification data in their dashboard (40-45% of US visitors)
- Need to manually check RB2B dashboard for names/LinkedIn profiles

**How it works:**
1. Visitor comes to site
2. You get email with basic info (location, device, etc.)
3. You manually check RB2B dashboard to see if they were identified
4. If identified, you'll see their name, LinkedIn, company in RB2B dashboard

### Option 2: Upgrade to RB2B Pro ($149/month)
**What you get:**
- **Webhook integration** - sends identified visitors directly to your email
- **Email addresses** included
- **70-80% identification rate** (vs 40-45% free)
- **Company-level identification**
- **Direct data access** for automated notifications

**How it works:**
1. Visitor comes to site
2. RB2B identifies them (if possible)
3. Webhook sends data directly to your email system
4. You get email with name, email, LinkedIn, company (when identified)

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
**Current setup + manual RB2B check:**
1. Keep current free system for basic notifications
2. Check RB2B dashboard periodically for identified visitors
3. Follow up with identified visitors manually
4. Upgrade to Pro later if you get more traffic

## RB2B Free vs Pro Comparison

| Feature | Free Plan | Pro Plan ($149/mo) |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Data Access** | Dashboard only | Dashboard + Webhooks + API |
| **Identification Rate** | 40-45% of US traffic | 70-80% of US traffic |
| **Email Addresses** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Company Info** | Person-level only | Person + Company level |
| **Real-time Notifications** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (webhooks) |
| **Credits/Month** | 150 | 300+ (various plans) |
| **Integrations** | Slack only | Zapier, Salesforce, HubSpot, etc. |

## What's Actually Happening Now

1. **RB2B Script**: ✅ Collecting visitor data, sending to RB2B servers
2. **Your Email System**: ✅ Sending basic visitor notifications
3. **RB2B Dashboard**: ✅ Showing identified visitors (check manually)
4. **Missing Link**: Data doesn't flow from RB2B to your email (requires Pro)

## Action Items

### Immediate (Free):
1. ✅ **Current system works** - you'll get basic visitor emails
2. ✅ **Check RB2B dashboard** regularly for identified visitors
3. ✅ **Follow up manually** with identified prospects

### Future (If traffic increases):
1. **Consider Pro upgrade** for automatic notifications with full visitor data
2. **Set up webhook integration** to get identified visitors in email automatically
3. **Use Zapier integration** for connecting to other tools

## How to Check RB2B Dashboard

1. Go to your RB2B dashboard
2. Look for "Person-Level Visitors" section
3. You'll see identified visitors with:
   - Full name
   - LinkedIn profile
   - Job title
   - Company
   - Visit history

## Current Implementation Status

✅ **Working**: Basic visitor notifications with location, device, browser info
✅ **Working**: RB2B script collecting data for their dashboard
❌ **Not Working**: Direct access to RB2B identification data in emails (requires Pro)

The system is actually working correctly - it's just that RB2B keeps the good stuff (names, emails, LinkedIn) behind their paywall!
