# Google Analytics 4 Setup Guide

## ‚úÖ What's Been Added

I've added Google Analytics 4 (GA4) tracking code to your website in the `<head>` section of `index.html`. However, you need to complete the setup by getting your actual Google Analytics measurement ID.

## üîß Next Steps Required

### Step 1: Create a Google Analytics Account

1. **Go to Google Analytics**: Visit [https://analytics.google.com/](https://analytics.google.com/)
2. **Sign in** with your Google account (use the same account as your Gmail)
3. **Click "Start measuring"** if you're new to GA

### Step 2: Set Up Your Property

1. **Create Account**:
   - Account Name: `Jai Nijhawan Portfolio`
   - Choose your data sharing settings (recommended: leave all checked)

2. **Create Property**:
   - Property Name: `jainijhawan.github.io`
   - Reporting Time Zone: `India Standard Time`
   - Currency: `Indian Rupee (INR)` or `US Dollar (USD)`

3. **Business Information**:
   - Industry: `Technology` or `Professional Services`
   - Business Size: `Small (1-10 employees)`
   - How you intend to use Google Analytics: Check relevant boxes

### Step 3: Set Up Data Stream

1. **Choose Platform**: Select **"Web"**
2. **Website URL**: `https://jainijhawan.github.io`
3. **Stream Name**: `Portfolio Website`
4. **Click "Create stream"**

### Step 4: Get Your Measurement ID

After creating the data stream, you'll see:
- **Measurement ID**: It looks like `G-XXXXXXXXXX`
- **Copy this ID** - you'll need it for the next step

### Step 5: Update Your Website Code

You need to replace `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` in your website with your actual measurement ID:

1. **Open** your `index.html` file
2. **Find** these two lines:
   ```html
   <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=GA_MEASUREMENT_ID"></script>
   ```
   and
   ```javascript
   gtag('config', 'GA_MEASUREMENT_ID');
   ```

3. **Replace** both instances of `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` with your actual ID (e.g., `G-ABC123DEF4`)

**Example:**
```html
<!-- Before -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=GA_MEASUREMENT_ID"></script>
<script>
    gtag('config', 'GA_MEASUREMENT_ID');
</script>

<!-- After (with your actual ID) -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-ABC123DEF4"></script>
<script>
    gtag('config', 'G-ABC123DEF4');
</script>
```

### Step 6: Deploy and Test

1. **Save** your `index.html` file
2. **Commit and push** changes to GitHub (if using GitHub Pages)
3. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for changes to deploy
4. **Visit your website** - this will send a test event to GA
5. **Check Google Analytics** - go to Reports > Realtime to see if your visit is tracked

## üìä What Google Analytics Will Track

Once set up, GA4 will automatically track:

- **Page Views**: Which pages visitors view
- **Sessions**: How long visitors stay on your site
- **User Demographics**: Age, gender, interests (when available)
- **Geographic Data**: Where visitors are from
- **Device Info**: Mobile vs desktop, browser type
- **Traffic Sources**: How visitors found your site (Google, direct, social media)
- **Popular Content**: Which sections of your portfolio get most attention
- **Bounce Rate**: How many visitors leave after viewing one page

## üéØ Key Metrics for Your Portfolio

**Most Important Reports:**
1. **Realtime**: See current visitors
2. **Audience > Demographics**: See visitor age/gender
3. **Audience > Geo**: See visitor locations
4. **Behavior > Site Content**: See most popular pages
5. **Acquisition**: See how people find your site

## üîß Advanced Setup (Optional)
